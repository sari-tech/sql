# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Your answer...
SCD Type 1 - Overwrite
In this approach there will be a 1:1 relationship between the customer and customer_address table. Every time there is an updated, the new address will replace the old address.
This seems good for handling user data privacy as only the required data is retained.(Example -Most retail stores keep just the current adress for delivery)
SCD Type 2 - Add new row
In this approach there will be multiple address entries for the same user with a start and end date to indicate the current address.
There may be privacy concerns as the user's old data is retained. It should be a good practice to get user authorization to retain this data. (Example - Government or background verification/tracking agencies)
```

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
Your answer...
The sample ERD has additional tables for Dbo like Error and Db log. Also, they have many more tables and attributes to make a functional bookstore. They also have additional attributes to take care of online orders, multiple currencies, regions. I would like to include these in a more elaborate version of my ERD.
